    "Modern deep learning frameworks rely heavily on *automatic differentiation*, a technique that efficiently computes gradients for optimizing complex models. PyTorch’s `autograd` module provides a powerful and flexible way to perform automatic differentiation, enabling gradient-based optimization with minimal effort. Whether you're training neural networks, computing derivatives for custom functions, or performing higher-order differentiation, `autograd` makes it seamless and effortless. In this tutorial, we'll explore how PyTorch tracks computations, calculates gradients using `.backward()` and `torch.autograd.grad()`, and handles multiple gradient computations. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how automatic differentiation works in PyTorch and how to apply it effectively in your own projects. The working knowledge you develop from this tutorial will also play a critical role in learning the implementation of physics-informed loss functions."
