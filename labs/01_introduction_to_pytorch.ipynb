        "Welcome to the PyTorch tutorial for the PADL class at the University of Virginia! This notebook aims to provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of PyTorch, and get you setup for writing your own neural networks. If you are already well-versed in PyTorch and have undertaken your neural network projects, you should be safe to just skim through this notebook.\n",

        "PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that empowers you to write your own neural networks and train them efficiently leveraging graphics processing units (GPU). While there are excellent alternatives such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#quickstart-colab-in-the-cloud), and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), PyTorch is a prominenet choice because it is well established, has an extensive developer community, is highly flexible and customizable, and is widely adopted by the research community. Many contemporary papers in PADL share their code in PyTorch, making it valuable to be proficient in. Furthermore, knowing PyTorch in depth is going to enable you to be capable of picking up other deep learning frameworks, as many of the modern deep learning frameworks share similar syntax and user interfaces.\n",

That said, this notebook is not meant to cover all the nitty gritty details of PyTorch and may skip through many details that might become useful in the future. If you would like to delve into those details, there are many great tutorials online, including the [\"60-min blitz\"](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/), and you are encouraged to explore those materials as supplement.\n",

Note that if you don't have a CUDA-supported GPU, you won't see such an extension. This is not going to be a problem for now, but you are going to need to find a computer resource that is equipped with a CUDA GPU in order to run more advanced examples in the future. Without CUDA, PyTorch will run calculations on your CPU, which will be significantly slower. If you are a UVA student, you may have access to Rivanna HPC that has GPU cores.

This is necessary for training deep neural networks using optimization methods such as gradient descent. This will also come handy when we implement, for example, *physics-informed neural networks* later.\n",
        "\n",
        "If our neural network would output a single scalar value, we would talk about taking the **derivative**, but you will see that quite often we will have **multiple** output variables (\"values\"); in that case we talk about **gradients**. It's a more general term.\n",

        "We can calculate the loss for a batch by simply performing a few tensor operations as those are automatically added to the computation graph. For instance, for binary classification, we can use Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) which is defined as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "where $y$ are our labels, and $x$ our predictions, both in the range of $[0,1]$. However, PyTorch already provides a list of predefined loss functions which we can use (see [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for a full list). For instance, for BCE, PyTorch has two modules: `nn.BCELoss()`, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()`. While `nn.BCELoss` expects the inputs $x$ to be in the range $[0,1]$, i.e. the output of a sigmoid, `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` combines a sigmoid layer and the BCE loss in a single class. This version is numerically more stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCE loss because of the logarithms applied in the loss function. Hence, it is adviced to use loss functions applied on \"logits\" where possible (remember to not apply a sigmoid on the output of the model in this case!). For our model defined above, we therefore use the module `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`."

We will discuss the specific optimizers and their differences later in the course, but will for now use the simplest of them: `torch.optim.SGD`. Stochastic Gradient Descent updates parameters by multiplying the gradients with a small constant, called learning rate, and subtracting those from the parameters (hence minimizing the loss). Therefore, we slowly move towards the direction of minimizing the loss. A good default value of the learning rate for a small network as ours is 0.1."

The function `optimizer.zero_grad()` sets the gradients of all parameters to zero. While this function seems less relevant at first, it is a crucial pre-step before performing backpropagation. If we call the `backward` function on the loss while the parameter gradients are non-zero from the previous batch, the new gradients would actually be added to the previous ones instead of overwriting them. This is done because a parameter might occur multiple times in a computation graph, and we need to sum the gradients in this case instead of replacing them.
